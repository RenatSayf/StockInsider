            Part One. Introduction.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most brokers have a very undervalued tool by traders - CFDs on shares of American
            companies, but almost no one uses it. And very in vain! These instruments are the most
            predictable precisely because of the open actions of smart money in these instruments.
            Well, let's take it all in order.
        </p>
        <p>
            A little bit about the benefits. The most important CFD on stocks has no expiration date, i.e. we
            will be able to hold this contract without time limits, often it is quite important
            point. But you have to pay for the good. The broker charges a commission and a spread on the contract for this, but
            these are insignificant amounts, they pay off without any problems. For example, if you trade CFDs on
            futures contracts, then they have an expiration date (expiration date),
            so you need to close your position and open on a new project - and this is another double
            spread + double commission.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, the CFD does not provide for physical ownership of the asset, which means that it disappears
            the need to supply the asset, and with it various additional costs, commissions and
            risks. Then there are small deposit requirements, unlike American brokers
            the stock market. As well as available margin trading, the collateral, on average, is only
            10%.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course - convenience. We can trade these instruments from our favorite MetaTrader with
            all its advantages. There is no need to study another platform and get used to it.
            I think enough about CFDs, let's spend more time getting to know smart money.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, who is smart money? It is customary to call people (or organizations) that
            they know what others do not know, and confidently make money on it. Somehow very
            mysterious, mysterious and illegal, what do you think? But in fact it's not really
            so.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not dispute that there are many illustrative examples of illegal use of insider information.
            information, but there is also a 100% legitimate part. This is the part we will learn
            use it for personal gain. So let's remove this curtain
            mystery and mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
            So who is the insider. This is a person or organization that has access to
            information that is not available to the general public. There is nothing in the very concept of "insider"
            criminal, there can be a crime only in cases of illegal use of this
            information about this is just below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here we have just come to the question of why we will trade CFDs on American
            stocks. The fact is that it is the United States that has the strongest control legislation
            actions of insiders. Each insider, after making a transaction, must report to
            the regulatory body, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). And the most
            the main thing is that this information is available for use.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sec-logo">
        <!-- <img src="images/sec-logo.jpg"/> -->
        <img src="file:///android_asset/strategy/images/sec-logo.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            For reference. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a government agency
            The United States, which is the main body that regulates and supervises the
            the American securities market. The Commission was established quite a long time ago, back in 1934. The goal
            The commission's creation was to restore investor confidence in the stock market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's not get ahead of ourselves until we get back to the insiders. Under US law
            insiders are called directors and employees of the company, as well as shareholders who own
            10% or more of the company's shares. Well, here I think it's clear who owns what
            information "firsthand". What kind of information can it be that can affect the price
            shares (or in our case, the CFD price). For example, it may be the signing of some
            an important contract that affects the company's prospects. Also, the insider is the first to know about
            a possible takeover of the company, he knows long before the publication of the reporting on his
            companies and so on, this list can be continued indefinitely. In one word,
            only an insider knows the real state of the company, whether it is healthy and promising or,
            on the contrary, there are big problems in the company at this stage of development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, when insiders are required to report on transactions, others
            investors often watch these deals. In addition, there is a separate concept
            investing, in which the behavior of insiders is given a leading role. Just this one
            concepts, we will follow. Of course, there may be a risk that an insider acquires
            stocks specifically to increase investor confidence or sells stocks contrary to financial
            the state of the company (for example, to diversify assets or to buy a house), but all
            we will already consider this in the following parts.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            Part Two. Reporting.
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the first part, we learned that every legitimate insider after the transaction must
            report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (let me remind you, he oversees and
            regulation of the securities market). They do this according to a special form that
            it is called Form 4 SEC (or simply Form 4). This form is immediately after filling out
            published on the commission's website - www.sec.gov in the "FILINGS" section. Well, this is so for
            information, we will not read and process hundreds of different documents in search of the right
            of course, there are special sites for this, which do it for us for free, but
            more on that later. Let's first analyze Form 4, look at it below in the figure.
        </p>
        <div>
            <a class="reference-center"
               href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000122520814005131/xslF345X03/doc4.xml">
                <!-- <img class="text-img" src="images/form-4.jpg"/> -->
                <img class="text-img" src="file:///android_asset/strategy/images/form-4.jpg">
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
            We have a small table in front of us, in which it is very conveniently done - the form itself is black,
            and the filled data is blue. So the form is well readable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure of all completed forms is the same. So, let's go straight to
            decoding the form, and let's start with the title table. By points (according to the table):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The name of the person who filled out the form, place of work and address. This is insider data,
                who submits the form
            </li>
            <li>
                Name the name of the company for which the insider transaction was made. As well as her ticker
                (this is a short name, the same ticker will be in your list of CFD instruments for
                stocks)
            </li>
            <li>
                The date of the earliest transaction. There may be several purchases or sales in the form, here
                the date of the very first transaction is indicated
            </li>
            <li>
                Correction to the form. It sometimes happens that the form is filled out with errors. Therefore, in order to
                to publish the correction of the error, you need to fill out form 4 again, and just in this
                the paragraph indicates the date of the first, erroneous form
            </li>
            <li>
                The relation of the person who fills out the application to the issuer. This is what we talked about in
                the first part, which insider. It can be the director of the company, some
                her other employee, the owner of 10% of the company's shares, or another person - in the stock below is
                detailed
            </li>
            <li>
                Type of application - one person, or a group of persons fills out the form
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As we have seen, a fairly simple table. Now consider Table 1 - "Non-derivative
            securities" (Table I - Non-Derivative Securities Acquired, Disposed of, or
            Beneficially Owned), which is information important for us:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The name of the type of security - here it will almost always be "common stock" - ordinary
                stocks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transaction date 2A is an extended field 2, in principle, it does not matter for us.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transaction code. For us, only "P" - purchase, from the English word purchase, and
                "S" - sale of shares (from sale) are important. Other options are possible here, but they do not have for
                we have no weight.
            </li>
            <li>
                The number of shares, then the code (it is not important to us) and the price at which the operation took place.
            </li>
            <li>
                The number of shares owned by the person after the transaction. Here we can see,
                for example, if an insider sold the entire remaining package, the figure will be zero.
            </li>
            <li>
                The form of ownership of shares is direct or indirect. A straight line is when a person who
                filled out a form, personally owns shares, indirect - this is, for example, a person owns
                shares through some kind of fund, etc. Well, in general, it's also not particularly important, because
                an insider wants to make a profit regardless of whether he owns shares directly or
                indirectly.
            </li>
            <li>
                The nature of indirect ownership of shares, filled in exactly how the person owns the shares,
                who filled out the form. Also, not an essential field.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Table 2 - Derivative Securities (Table II - Derivative Securities Acquired,
            Disposed of, or Beneficially Owned), here we are talking about options, warrants,
            convertible securities. There are similar fields here, there is no need to stop at this table
            it doesn't make much sense, it's basically not used for trading.
        </p>
        <p>
            And even below there is an item "Explanation of Responses" (notes) - here there is an explanation to
            footnotes of the completed form. This point sometimes has weight, but I haven't considered it for a long time
            it, and this does not prevent you from earning, in principle, you can also miss it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, as in all documents, the insider's signature and the date of filling in. That's the whole form.
            Nothing complicated, but a lot of useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this particular form 4, we see that the insider is Williams Gates (more familiar to us as
            Bill Gates), who is one of the directors of Microsoft (also, I think everyone
            we are also familiar with this company) sold 4,761,637 shares of his company on February 14, 2014
            at an average price of $37.6062 per share, and on February 18, 2014, he sold another 6
            488,363 shares at an average price of 37.5289.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, there are notes here that indicate that the shares were bought in the price range,
            also that some of the shares are owned by Gates' wife. I.e., as I indicated, there are no notes in the notes
            nothing interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, in this chapter we have considered the main fundamental part of the analysis of actions
            insiders, namely, its primary source - Form 4 SEC. So, we already know the physics of the process
            we know, and in the next part, we will already look at how to practically make a profit from this
            information.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            Part three. Making money.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Well, we have all the preparatory information, now we can look at how to
            make money on it. As it was written earlier, an insider, as, indeed, any participant
            the market, by its actions pursues one goal - to make a profit. And therefore, the most
            a simple trading option is to buy after an insider has done it, and close
            the position after he sells. A fairly simple, but very effective strategy,
            let's look at some examples in the figures, what comes out of this:
        </p>
        <div>
            <!-- <img class="text-img" src="images/chart-1.jpg"/> -->
            <img class="text-img" src="file:///android_asset/strategy/images/chart-1.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>
            This example illustrates well that the insider knows best what his company is
            worth. He bought at the bottom and came out at the highs. As you can see, he took almost all of the software
            the maximum trend. At the same time, the risk was about 5% with a profit of 45% (without leverage), i.e.
            the risk-profit ratio is 1 to 9. And to this, he received dividends two more times.
        </p>
        <div>
            <!-- <img class="text-img" src="images/chart-2.jpg"/> -->
            <img class="text-img" src="file:///android_asset/strategy/images/chart-2.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>
            And here in the example you can see how clearly the insider acts, buying at the very bottom, and selling at
            the maximum, making 25% of the profit without leverage and by this he receives dividends twice. At the same time
            the risk is almost zero, the stock immediately began active growth. There are many such examples, I
            will not dwell on them much, since the picture, I think, is very clear.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next moment. There won't be signals on a separate promotion every week, but thanks to that,
            that dealing centers have quite large lists of CFDs on stocks, then there will always be trading
            what. By the way, this strategy is very well suited for those who do not have the opportunity
            constantly sit at the monitor. It's enough to look at insider deals once a day, and if
            if there is something interesting, then make changes to your account and that's it. This strategy is very
            close to investing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important point, this strategy works great for buying CFDs on stocks, but it does not
            will work for sales. Why? Everything is simple. What an insider buys, we all
            we understand - in order to make a profit, but with sales everything is different. For sales can
            there may be different reasons, for example, he (an insider) does he want to pay off the loan, or does he need it urgently
            it is necessary to buy new housing, etc., so the sale of shares by an insider will not always be
            it means that this is the peak of growth, in many cases it is not. Therefore, I am extremely not
            I recommend entering a short position when an insider is selling, and using it
            sales are only for closing your purchases.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the last moment. When opening an account for trading CFDs on stocks, choose swap-free
            bills. The fact is that in most cases, the deal must be kept for more than one week, and no
            it makes no sense to lose money on swaps (sometimes a lot), especially if there is an opportunity not to
            pay for the transfer of a position through the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the above can be used not only as a holistic strategy, but also as part of
            some kind of strategy of his own. No one bothers to add elements of technical analysis or
            take into account macrostatistics or corporate reporting of companies in addition. This is already
            to your taste, but there is a fundamental basis for further work (if you suddenly don't want to
            use as is).
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for attention. Good luck to everyone and safe profits!
